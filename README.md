# cub3d
Textured 2D raycaster with sprites, map validator, screenshots.
It uses miniLibX (OpenGL) to display and a tiny amount of linux functions (restrictions of school task)
 
Idea of project is to create a “realistic” 3D graphical
representation of the inside of a maze from a
first-person perspective using the Ray-Casting principles (like in Wolfenshtein 3d)

Image adopting for screen size, which you could change in file , but it uses a lot of CPU, 
there are map, which you could change, but it should be valid, otherwise you will got an error

To make it display faster used simple buffer
